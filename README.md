Using matlab to solve an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) problem


## Problem:
...Once the tandem bungee jumpers
have stopped oscilating, they will
release themselves from the cord and
start falling freely. During the initial
fall the air resistance is, c1 = 0.40
kg/m. After a certain time they will
open the parachute and the air
resistance increases to c2 = 0.85
kg/m.


The platform is located at an altitude
of 2 km while the river below is at a
500 m altitude. The elevation of the
river changes by 10 m for every km.
The wind profile power law relationship is:
u/ur = (z/zr)^0.143
where u is the wind speed (in metres per second) at height z (in metres), and ur = 10
m/s is the known wind speed at the reference height zr corresponding to the platform
(all heights are measured from the river water level). The wind blows only in a
horizontal direction along the canyon.


Use the shooting method to find the duration of the free fall from the moment they
release from the cord to the moment they open the parachute if they are to land 300 m
downstream from the platform location on their desired target landing zone in the
middle of the river.
